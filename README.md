# Lancaster Music Hall â€“ Analysis & Design Documents

This repository contains the analysis and design work I contributed to a university team project.

## My Role
I worked as the **Analyst and Designer**, responsible for:
- Gathering and organizing functional and non-functional requirements
- Querying the customer and analysing customer requirements
- Creating system diagrams and UI mockups to guide software development

## Contents
- Requirements specifications
- Design diagrams
- Customer material

Note: All work displayed here was completed solely by me other than:
- Design/Box Office ERD v2.vpp (design diagram refinement of my original ERD created by a team member)
- Design/System GUI Draft v3.docx (document created by a team member, and GUIs displayed here were developed by both me and that team member, also viewable [here on Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVIJj2NQY=/?share_link_id=118773702787))
